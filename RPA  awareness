## RPA???

RPA is the technology that allows computer software to mimic actions 
typically performed by humans interacting with digital systems to execute business processes.

#### And while RPA is not the only type of automation out there, it's probably the most talked about. Here's why:

- RPA is non-invasive
It does not require any major IT architecture changes or deep integration with the underlying systems. 
RPA offers a reliable, fast and cost-efficient solution for a “light-weight” integration into processes and IT assets.

- RPA is easy to scale
The amount of work involved by a process can vary, as changes are likely to occur in most business environments. 
If an RPA solution is used, companies can easily adapt by scaling the solution up or down, depending on the requirements.

- RPA is future proof
Robots work with today’s technology, yet the automations are extensible, able to handle tomorrow’s technology.
